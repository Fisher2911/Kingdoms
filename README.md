## Wiki coming soon

# Features:

- Creating kingdoms and adding members
- Upgrading bank limit, max claims, max members, max relationships, using equations for both price and values, and more upgrades to come
- Very customizable GUI's, with the ability to add as many as you want
- As many roles as you want to add, and soon the option for kingdoms to create their own roles
- Kingdoms can customize individual chunk permissions and overall permissions, with overall permissions overriding chunk permissions if they are true.
  For example, if block-break is false in the kingdom but true in the chunk, then breaking blocks is allowed in the chunk. If block-break is set to true in the kingdom but false in the chunk,
  then block breaking in the chunk is still allowed.
- Customizable help messages + all other messages
- WorldGuard hook for denying the ability to claim land in certain regions
- Vault hook for buying upgrades and using /k bank
- Chat Channels
- Developer API soon
- More to come!
